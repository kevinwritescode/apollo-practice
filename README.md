# 🚀 Apollo Practice

Apollo Server NodeJS Practice, experimenting with Node TS, type generated GQL, and basic auth concepts.

Goals 🥅 of this exercise:

1. Get comfortable with GQL concepts
2. Explore schema file structure strategies
3. Try GQL to Typescript Defs pipeline
4. Explore Apollo Server Express authorization vs authentication strategies
5. Explore Apollo Sandbox features
6. Practice Typescript generics

Next things to implement:

1. GQL unions and inline fragments `... on Droid {}`
2. directives `(@include(if) @skip(if))`
3. Passport authentication layer

# 💡 GQL Best Practices

Just a few notes I gathered while reviewing

- Establish a naming convention like createUser vs userCreate
- Be as specific as possible with mutations
- Only one argument for mutations, the input
- Have specific payload response per mutation for future expansion
- Disable introspection in production

# 🔀 Pre Merge Best Practices

- Github Actions (or Jenkin) protections on merge to main
- Unit, Integration, and E2E tests to confirm safety of work
- Require 1 to several PR reviews, reset requirement on changes

# 👩‍💻 Deployment Best Practices

- Release in small, frequent changes - do not scope creep
- Release features in off states if it helps be more continuous
- Have rollback plans in place, ensure data can't corrupt on rollback
- Use expand and contract data model to maintain old and new clients
- Observe route usage and confirm zero use before deprecating code
- Setup a blue/green deployment to slowly release new features
